### Comments

Great proposal overall with a unique target! You've described dataset concisely and listed potential errors in the data. The algorithms also have clear input/output as well as time/space complexity. It misses a minor detail around DFS, however. Anyway, the timeline also looks reasonable, with a potential extension if time allows.

We'd like to see more on the leading question in the next iteration. Other than pure curiosity, are there other motivations to finding shortest paths between subreddits and the most central subreddit? Why should we know about them? Is there an application?

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further question or need clarification. Keep up the great work!
