# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every ___ using Discord. Each member will rotate being designated as a notetaker starting with nshiv3. These notes will be kept in a folder on our github page denoted notes. This notetaker will also be responsible for filling out the development log for that week. 
2. **Assistance** We will communicate using Discord and we should expect replies within 48 hours, excepting extenuating circumstances. 
3. **Respect** The notetaker will also be the discussion leader for the week and they will be expected to allow everyone's voice to be heard and facilitate a good group dynamic. All decisions will be made by majority with the tiebreak going to the notetaker for the week if necessary. Even if someone disagrees with the decision made, we sign this contract understanding that we will uphold the decision regardless. 

## Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week during our meeting, we will decide on what needs to be done in the coming week. From that list, people will volunteer for what they want to do. If there is a task that no one wants to take, then we will assign it randomly, but also ensuring that the workload of one person does not outstrip that of another. Adjustments to the "randomness" will be necessary at that point. 
2. **Time Commitment** Everyone should aim to work between 3 and 5 hours a week, barring unforseen complications. If someone's weekly work takes significantly more time, we will decide as a group whether to push the work back to next week or to have someone split the work for that week. This is in order to ensure equal time spent. 
3. **Conflict Resolution** We will address conflicts at our weekly meetings and discuss the issue amongst ourselves. We then will vote on the issue with the notetaker being the tiebreaker again. For instance, if someone does not complete their work, we will mention it at the meeting, and if it continues, further action will be taken, including but not limited to, notifying course staff.
