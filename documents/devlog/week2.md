# Week 2:

# Goals:
Finish DFS and begin trying to count connected components using this traversal. We may also attempt to start implementing the other algorithms, such as Floyd-Warshall because of its relative simplicity.

# Tasks:
Was able to configure the data to make it easier to process for our purposes and was able to complete making the graph implementation that uses a csv file that has our modified data. Partially completed implementing our adjacency matrix as well, so we will actually start our algorithms over the course of the coming week.


# Problems:
No problems that stand out as of now.


# Goals for Next Week:
Finish up the adjacency matrix and lists and start implementing the algorithms that we outlined in our proposal. We will also add the user prompt where they can type in 2 different subreddits, guage where we are and if we have time to do a visual representation.
