# Week 4

## Goals
Finish Floyd-Warshall algorithm and prepare for Betweeness Centrality. Write unit tests for matrix representation of graph and improve tests for dfs. 

## Tasks
Testing Nihal's implementation of Floyd-Warshal algorithm to make sure it works and add test cases.

## Problems
There was an excessive amount of data which needed to be removed to have Floyd-Warhall run in a reasonable time, so Chris handled the data and added test cases and completed Betweeness Centrality. Meanwhile, the rest of the team worked on test cases and making sure the algorithms are functional.

## Goals for Next Week
Complete the remainder of the test cases to make sure the code is completely functional and prepare for the presentation.
