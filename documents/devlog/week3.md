# Week 3

## Goals
We finished all of the data processing, though we still have tests to write. 

## Tasks
Nihal wrote and finished the matrix implementation for reading in data. Chris, Sarah, and Shrijan all worked on the graph implementation. 

## Problems
No problems as of right now

## Goals for Next Week
Make a working test environment and write tests for the implementations. This is so we don't have errors in the algorithms later on because of the way that we are storing data in memory.
