# Week 1
## Goals
We will attempt to obtain usable data for the project from the Stanford Dataset on subreddits. This goal is close to being accomplished as the data is close to being accomplished.

## Tasks
Chris made a significant chunk of progress on the preprocessing to reduce the size of the data while the rest of the group helped decide which columns would be useful to keep and remove.

## Problems
There was a significant amount of unnecessary data that was not expected which ended up taking more time to clean up than anticipated.

## Goals For Next Week
Next week, we plan to finish processing the data to make it usable, and we will also attempt to complete the depth first search algorithm although this will be dependent on how much time is available.
